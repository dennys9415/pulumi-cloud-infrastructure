# Multi-Cloud Deployment

## Overview

This project supports deploying infrastructure across multiple cloud providers for high availability and disaster recovery.

## Supported Patterns

### 1. Active-Active Deployment
- Applications running simultaneously on multiple clouds
- Global load balancer distributing traffic

### 2. Active-Passive Deployment
- Primary cloud handles production traffic
- Secondary cloud ready for failover

### 3. Cloud-Specific Services
- Leverage unique services from each provider
- Example: AWS Lambda + Azure Functions + GCP Cloud Run

## Deployment

```bash
cd multi-cloud
pulumi stack init production
pulumi up
```

## Configuration

### Cross-Cloud Networking

* VPC peering (where supported)

* VPN connections between clouds

* Direct Connect / ExpressRoute / Cloud Interconnect

### Data Replication

* Database replication between clouds

* Object storage synchronization

* Configuration management

### Best Practices

* Consistent Naming: Use consistent naming across clouds

* Unified Monitoring: Centralized logging and monitoring

* Disaster Recovery: Test failover procedures regularly

* Cost Management: Monitor and optimize cross-cloud costs
